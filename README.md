> Roadmap to becoming a computer scientist in 2021.
> Inspired by [web-dev-roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap)

***

<p>
Below you find a set of charts demonstrating the paths that you can take and the subject fields or subject  that you want to adopt in order to become good computer scientist.  I made these charts for an old professor of mine who wanted something to share with his college students to give them a perspective;

<b>sharing them here to help the community.</b>

<h3 align="center"><strong>Purpose of these Roadmaps</strong></h3>

> The purpose of these roadmaps is to give you an idea about the landscape and to guide you if you are confused about what to learn next and not to encourage you to pick what is hip and trendy. You should grow some understanding of why one tool would be better suited for some cases than the other and remember hip and trendy never means best suited for the job.

***

<h3 align="center"><strong>Note to Beginners</strong></h3>

> These roadmaps cover everything that is there to learn for the paths listed below. 
> _Don't feel overwhelmed_,
> you don't need to learn it all in the beginning if you are just getting started. We are working on the beginner versions of these and will release it soon after we are done with the 2020 release of roadmaps.

> If you think that these can be improved in any way, please do suggest.
